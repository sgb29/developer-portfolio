            <h3>Assistant Teacher at JCPSC</h3>
            <p>I am in teaching profession. I have been teaching since 2009. It is my passion and hobby and ofcourse I
                am
                very good at it. About me??? Don't know.... For 25 long years I was in a thought of knowing myself, but
                it
                appeared only a delusion. It is impossible to know a complex creature like human, even thyself.....
                Another fact, I don't like to accept someone's friend request on facebook who has not a detailed profile
                or
                own picture on pp and don't even bother to share identity....:)</p>
