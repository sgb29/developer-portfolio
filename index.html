            <h3>Assistant Teacher at JCPSC</h3>
            <p>I am in teaching profession. I have been teaching since 2009. It is my passion and hobby and ofcourse I
                am
                very good at it. About me??? Don't know.... For 25 long years I was in a thought of knowing myself, but
                it
                appeared only a delusion. It is impossible to know a complex creature like human, even thyself.....
                Another fact, I don't like to accept someone's friend request on facebook who has not a detailed profile
                or
                own picture on pp and don't even bother to share identity....:)</p>

                <p>One, two, three, four
                    I think I'm losing my mind
                    Trying to stay inside the lines
                    It's like I'm running in place
                    How you keep staying the same?
                    Baby, I, I guess I'm something different
                    And I'm okay with that
                    I can't fake no more smiles
                    That shit gon' drive me mad
                    I'm focused on the future
                    Don't care 'bout nothin' else
                    Oh oh oh
                    I'm better by myself
                    I'm better by myself
                    I don't need no one else
                    I'm better by myself

                <p>Don't wanna answer questions
                    Just want your company
                    It's all good on the surface
                    Show me what's underneath
                    I'm not concerned with drama
                    I left that shit in school
                    I'm more concerned with commas
                    Than keeping up with you
                    Keep that away from me
                    I put the Heisman up to bad energy
                    No empathy, especially when the kid off Hennessy
                    Fake friends to me make my mood go south like Tennessee
                    Make the fool come out like, "Who is he?"
                    I mean, I tried to tell y'all</p>
